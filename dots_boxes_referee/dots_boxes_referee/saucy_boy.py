# Input: Two tuples (representing the points for a potential move)
# Input: Array of the current board-state
# Output: Boolean (true if the move suggested is valid)
# Purpose: To check if a given move is valid

# Input: Int of how long to run the timer
# Output: Boolean (true when timer runs out)
# Purpose: To tell how long a certain time has passed
